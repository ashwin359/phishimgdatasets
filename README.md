Phishing Website Dataset — URL-Based Classification

This dataset contains labeled phishing and legitimate URLs for building and evaluating machine-learning models that detect phishing attacks using only URL information.

Dataset Contents

* **url** — the full website address
* **label** — `1` = phishing, `0` = legitimate
* *(Optional)* additional URL-derived features such as length, number of special characters, presence of IP address, number of subdomains, etc.

Purpose

To support research on:

* URL-based phishing detection
* Machine learning classification
* Security analytics and threat intelligence
* Email and browser phishing protection

Data Sources

Typical sources may include phishing feeds (e.g., PhishTank, OpenPhish) and trusted benign URL lists (e.g., Alexa/Tranco top sites).
Adjust this section to match your actual sources.

Ethical Use
